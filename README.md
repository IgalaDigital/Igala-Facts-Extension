# Contributors Guide

### Prerequisites
- Git or any equivalent Version Control System (GitKraten, GitHub Desktop e.t.c)
- Code Editor (VsCode, Atom e.t.c)
- Little Bash command line knowledge
- Basic JavaScript knowledge

### Getting Started

1.  If you are new to Git and Github, it is advisable you go through
    [GitHub For Beginners](http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1/)
    before moving to the next step.
    
2.  Fork the Repository [here](https://github.com/IgalaDigital/Igala-Facts-Extension)

3.  Clone the forked Repository <br>
`$ git clone https://github.com/IgalaDigital/Igala-Facts-Extension.git`

4.  Enter the cloned directory <br>
`cd Igala-Facts-Extension`

5.  Open directory in your Code Editor <br>
`code .`

6.  Load the extension in Developer's Mode as 'UnPacked'
    - Open your Chrome Browser
    - Click on the three dots at the upper right corner of your tab
    - Select `More Tools`
    - Select `Extensions`
    - Click on the `Load UnPacked` button at the upper left corner
    - Locate the directory you cloned the repository to and Click OK
    - Now the Extension should be added to the list in Developer's Mode
    - Open a `New Tab` to preview the extension
    - Now when you make changes to the cloned repository, this Unpacked Extension would be updated

All Facts are stored in a JSON file which can be found here `src/facts.json`
Quotes are stored in this format
```
[
    {
        "number": "1",
	"publisher": "Ilemona",
        "quote": "Did you know that Gov Yahaya Bello is now the onu ogwu of igala land?. - Demo Fact"
    }
]
```
To add a new Fact this Extension; you need to add the Fact to the `JSON file`

## STEP ONE
- Every Fact has a designated number, so check the number of the last fact before we proceed
- You should have your fact and publisher name already
- Facts are in this format
```
{
        "number": "1",
	"publisher": "Ilemona",
        "quote": "Did you know that Gov Yahaya Bello is now the onu ogwu of igala land?. - Demo Fact"
},
```
- The last fact does not end with a `,` after the curly brackets `}`
- Any fact before the last facts ends with a `,`
- To add your fact; first add a `,` to the last fact after the curly bracket `}`
- Copy and paste this code after the last fact before the `]`
```
{
        "number": "1",
	"publisher": "Ilemona",
        "quote": "Did you know that Gov Yahaya Bello is now the onu ogwu of igala land?. - Demo Fact"
}
```
- Now edit that code snippet to show your own fact; <br>
(Change the number to the last number, add your Publisher name and Fact)


## STEP TWO
- Push your files <br>
```shell
$ git add --all
$ git commit -m "commit description here"
$ git push -u origin master
```
- Open a Pull Request ( [What is a pull request?](https://yangsu.github.io/pull-request-tutorial/) )
- Add enough description of what you did, changes you made and if possible screenshots
- Wait for Review (Your PR would be reviewed and merged if deemed fit)
